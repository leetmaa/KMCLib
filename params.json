Commun. 185 (2014) 2340\r\n\r\n### *KMCLib* is now in version 1.1\r\n*KMCLib* is a general framework for *lattice* kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, to simulate the time evolution of systems of up to millions of particles in one, two or three dimensions. *KMCLib* is organized as a collection of Python frontend functions, classes and interfaces for performing efficient *lattice* KMC simulations, with all computationally heavy backend functionality implemented in C++.\r\n\r\nVersion *1.1* introduces support for different random number generators, and increased support for different platforms and compiles. Random numbers are now generated using the standard (C++11) library and *KMCLib* from now on supports the use of both the Mersenne-Twister and the RANLUX PRNG:s through the standard C++ library. Additionally the standard minimal PRNG is also available, as well as true random numbers if you have a random device installed. The make system is upgraded to provide support for additional platforms and compilers. We now support the **clang** compiler on Mac OSX, and both the **gcc** and the **Intel C++ compiler** under Linux. Support for the **Intel C++ compiler** was requested for use in particular on large computer clusters with little flexibility to change compilers.\r\n\r\n### The combination of features makes *KMCLib* unique\r\n* Python user interface - well documented, easily extended.\r\n* C++ backend library for maximizing efficiency.\r\n* Easy to prototype KMC models - no need to recompile source to run new models.\r\n* Arbitrarily complex elementary processes can be used.\r\n* On-the-fly evaluation of custom rate expressions written in Python.\r\n* Built in on-the-fly mean square displacement (MSD) analysis to facilitate diffusion studies.\r\n* MPI parallelism without loss of accuracy.\r\n\r\n### Well documented with usage examples and install instructions\r\nThe code manual (http://leetmaa.github.io/KMCLib/manual-v1.1/) includes full documentation of the Python interface and several usage examples, as well as installation instructions for both Linux and Mac.\r\n\r\n### Known issues\r\nAt the time of writing there are no known bugs or issues, but as always, if you happen to find any bugs or issues, or if you have suggestions for improvements, please let me know.\r\n\r\n### Obtain a copy\r\nThe program is distributed under the GPLv3 license and can be obtained from the *KMCLib* git repository https://github.com/leetmaa/KMCLib/releases/tag/v1.1\r\n\r\n### Use *KMCLib* in your own research\r\nIf you would be interested to use this code in your research and need any assistance, or if you are interested in collaborations, please don't hesitate to send me an e-mail: leetmaa@kth.se\r\n\r\n\r\nMikael Leetmaa, May 28 2015\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
